 Final verification checklist

PHASE 1: DIAGNOSIS & DEBUGGING [Lead: Opus 4.1 Debug Lead]
Agent Team 1: Root Cause Analysis (2 Sonnet Agents)
Agent 1A: Context Detection Debugger
python# Focus: backend/app/services/chat_service.py
# Lines 356-382 - detect_context_continuity() function

TASKS:
1. Add extensive logging to detect_context_continuity()
2. Log ALL similarity scores between messages
3. Log the actual threshold values being compared
4. Trace why similarity > 0.7 still returns False
5. Check for logic inversions or incorrect operators
6. Verify embedding generation consistency
7. Test with hardcoded similarity values to isolate issue

EXPECTED BUGS TO FIND:
- Inverted boolean logic (returning False when should return True)
- Incorrect comparison operators (< instead of >)
- Type mismatch in similarity calculations
- Async/await issues in embedding generation
- Cache invalidation problems
Agent 1B: Embedding Pipeline Validator
python# Focus: Ollama embedding generation and vector similarity

TASKS:
1. Verify nomic-embed-text model is properly loaded
2. Test embedding consistency for identical text
3. Validate cosine_similarity calculations
4. Check embedding dimension compatibility
5. Test with simple strings to verify pipeline
6. Add unit tests for each embedding function

TEST CASES:
- Same text → similarity should be 1.0
- Related text → similarity should be > 0.7
- Unrelated text → similarity should be < 0.3
Agent Team 2: Database & Dependencies (2 Sonnet Agents)
Agent 2A: SQLAlchemy Relationship Fixer
python# Fix database model relationships preventing authentication

TASKS:
1. Install missing langchain_ollama dependency
2. Fix SQLAlchemy mapper configuration errors
3. Verify all foreign key relationships
4. Test authentication flow end-to-end
5. Add proper cascade rules
6. Fix any circular dependencies
Agent 2B: SQLite Memory Debugger
python# Verify conversation memory persistence

TASKS:
1. Test SQLite conversation storage
2. Verify message retrieval ordering
3. Check conversation_context table updates
4. Test summary generation after 20 messages

/clear checkpoint 1
After Phase 1 diagnosis, lead agent consolidates findings in CHAT_FIX_TRACKING.md before proceeding.
PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION FIXES [Lead: Opus 4.1 Integration Lead]
Agent Team 3: Core Fix Implementation (3 Sonnet Agents)
Agent 3A: Context Detection Rewrite
python# Complete rewrite of context detection logic

async def detect_context_shift(self, message: str, history: List[Dict], conversation_id: str) -> Dict:

    """
    # NEW IMPLEMENTATION:
    # 1. Get embeddings for current message
    # 2. Get embeddings for last 5 user messages
    # 3. Calculate weighted similarity (recent messages weighted higher)
    # 4. Check for explicit context markers
    # 5. Return CORRECT boolean based on threshold
    
    # CRITICAL FIX:
    # if similarity >= self.config.context_similarity_threshold:
    #     return {'shift_detected': False, ...}  # NO SHIFT
    # else:
    #     return {'shift_detected': True, ...}   # SHIFT DETECTED
Agent 3B: Context Cache Manager
python# Implement robust context caching

TASKS:
1. Implement conversation-specific context cache
2. Add TTL-based cache invalidation
3. Implement cache warming on conversation load
4. Add cache hit/miss metrics
5. Test cache persistence across messages
Agent 3C: RAG Pipeline Enhancer
python# Enhance document retrieval with context awareness

TASKS:
1. Implement query expansion using conversation history
2. Add document reranking based on conversation context
3. Implement sliding window for context relevance
4. Add citation deduplication across messages
5. Test retrieval accuracy with context

CONTEXT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
Strategic /clear Points:

After Phase 1 diagnosis (consolidate findings)
After Phase 2 fixes (prepare for testing)
After Phase 3 testing (prepare for integration)
After Phase 4 validation (prepare final report)

Before Each /clear:

Update CHAT_FIX_TRACKING.md
Save test results to TEST_RESULTS_{phase}.md
Document any new issues found
Create checkpoint summary

After Each /clear:

Load CHAT_FIX_TRACKING.md
Review last phase results
Load relevant code files
Continue from checkpoint

SUCCESS CRITERIA
The chat component is ONLY considered complete when:

Context Detection: Works 100% of the time with proper thresholds
Donut Test: Passes EXACTLY as specified in requirements
20-Turn Test: Maintains context through extended conversation
Performance: Meets all specified metrics
Integration: Works seamlessly with frontend
Security: Passes all security tests
Documentation: Complete with examples

EXECUTION TIMELINE
Total Estimated Time: 16-24 hours

Phase 1: 4-6 hours (debugging)
Phase 2: 3-4 hours (implementation)
Phase 3: 4-6 hours (testing)
Phase 4: 3-4 hours (integration)
Phase 5: 2-4 hours (final verification)

FINAL DELIVERABLE
Create CHAT_COMPLETION_REPORT.md containing:

Root cause analysis of original bug
Complete fix implementation details
All test results (must be 100% pass)
Performance benchmarks
Security audit results
Video/GIF demonstration of working chat
Code coverage report
Recommendations for future enhancements

CRITICAL REMINDERS

DO NOT PROCEED past any phase until context detection is 100% fixed
TEST EXHAUSTIVELY - The chat must work perfectly
NO WORKAROUNDS - Fix the root cause, not symptoms
DOCUMENT EVERYTHING - Every fix and test result
USE MANY AGENTS - Maximum parallelization for speed
VERIFY THREE TIMES - Test, retest, then test again
CONTEXT IS KING - The chat MUST maintain conversation context

START EXECUTION
Begin immediately with Phase 1 diagnosis. Deploy all agents in parallel. The chat component MUST be 100% functional with perfect context detection before mission complete.
FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION - This is the crown jewel of Allemny Find V2.
