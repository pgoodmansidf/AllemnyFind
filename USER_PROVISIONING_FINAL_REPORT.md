## SECURITY FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Enhanced Password Security
```python
# New password validation requirements:
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- Rejection of common weak passwords
- Backend enforcement (not just frontend)
```

### 2. Token Blacklisting System
```python
# Server-side token invalidation on logout:
- Tokens added to blacklist on logout
- Blacklist checked during token verification
- Automatic cleanup of expired tokens
- Prevents session hijacking after logout
```

### 3. Enhanced Email Domain Validation
```python
# Stricter domain validation:
- Government domain requirements (.gov.sa)
- Enhanced format validation
- Suspicious pattern detection
- Improved error messaging
```

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Comprehensive input validation
- Graceful error responses
- Security-focused error messaging
- Pagination parameter validation
