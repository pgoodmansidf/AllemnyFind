**Results:** Successfully detected non-contextual topic switches while properly identifying "what about" patterns as contextual references.

### 2. Very Long Messages ✅
**Accuracy:** 100% | **Time:** <0.001s | **Status:** PASS

Tests handling of 5000+ character messages with context detection.

**Key Findings:**
- Handles long messages (7,599+ characters) without performance degradation

**Results:** Effectively identifies pronouns and contextual references with high accuracy.

### 8. What About Validation ✅
**Accuracy:** 100% | **Time:** <0.001s | **Status:** PASS

Tests "what about" pattern validation to prevent false positives.

**Results:** Successfully differentiates between contextual and non-contextual "what about" usage.

### 9. Multi-Factor Scoring ✅
**Accuracy:** 100% | **Time:** <0.001s | **Status:** PASS

Tests the multi-factor decision algorithm with various factor combinations.

**Results:** All decision pathways function correctly with appropriate threshold adjustments.

### 10. Decision Pathways ✅
**Accuracy:** 100% | **Time:** <0.001s | **Status:** PASS

Tests coverage of all four decision pathways in the enhanced logic.

**Results:** Successfully exercises all pathway combinations with correct decisions.

### 11. Performance Stress Test ✅
**Time:** <0.001s | **Status:** PASS

Tests performance with large conversation histories (30+ messages).

**Results:** Maintains sub-millisecond performance even with extensive conversation history.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Meta-Question Detection (Minor)
**Impact:** Medium
**Priority:** Low
**Issue:** Meta-questions about the conversation itself not consistently detected as contextual.

**Examples:**

**Impact:** Low
**Priority:** Very Low
**Issue:** Minor JSON serialization issue with numpy boolean types in test reports.

**Status:** Does not affect core functionality, only test reporting.

2. **Fix JSON Serialization:** Convert numpy types to native Python types in test outputs

### Future Enhancements
1. **Context Memory:** Implement longer-term context memory beyond current conversation
2. **Learning Adaptation:** Add machine learning to improve thresholds based on user patterns
3. **Multi-Language Support:** Extend context detection to non-English conversations
