# Context Detection Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the `detect_context_continuity` function in `backend/app/services/chat_service.py` with sophisticated multi-factor context detection.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Logging
- Added detailed debug and info logging for all similarity calculations
- Tracks raw similarity, weighted similarity, and entity overlap scores
- Provides clear decision rationale in logs

### 2. Weighted Similarity with Sliding Window
- Extended context window from 3 to 5 recent messages
- Implemented exponential time-based weighting (recent messages weighted higher)
- Formula: `time_weight = 0.5 ** (window_size - message_index - 1)`

### 3. Explicit Context Markers Detection
- **Pronouns**: it, that, this, they, them, their, its, these, those
- **References**: above, mentioned, previous, earlier, before, same, such
- **Continuations**: also, additionally, furthermore, moreover, besides, and
- **Contextual Questions**: "what about", "how about", "what else", "tell me more"

### 4. Entity Overlap Detection
- Extracts proper nouns, quoted phrases, technical terms
- Calculates Jaccard similarity between current query and recent messages
- Adjusts context threshold when entity overlap is high

### 5. Multi-Factor Decision Logic
Context is detected when ANY of these conditions are met:
1. Explicit context markers found → **Immediate True**
2. Max weighted similarity ≥ threshold (0.45, adjusted down if entity overlap > 0.3)
3. Average weighted similarity ≥ 70% of threshold AND entity overlap > 0.2
4. Max raw similarity ≥ 0.6 (high semantic similarity regardless of timing)

## Test Results
All 6 test scenarios passed:
- ✅ Pronoun Reference Test (their)
- ✅ Entity Overlap Test (Project Alpha-7)
- ✅ Contextual Question Test (tell me more)
- ✅ No Context Test (unrelated topics)
- ✅ Continuation Word Test (Also)
- ✅ Weighted Similarity Test (renewable energy topics)

## Technical Implementation
- Added `re` import for pattern matching
- Created helper methods: `_detect_context_markers()` and `_calculate_entity_overlap()`
- Maintained same function signature for backward compatibility
- Enhanced error handling and logging throughout

## Performance Impact
- Minimal overhead added
- Smart early returns for explicit context markers
- Efficient regex patterns for entity extraction
- Caching-friendly embedding calls

## Usage Example Log Output
```
INFO: Context continuity decision: True
INFO:   - Max raw similarity: 0.664
INFO:   - Max weighted similarity: 0.332
INFO:   - Avg weighted similarity: 0.199
INFO:   - Entity overlap score: 0.000
INFO:   - Adjusted threshold: 0.450
```

The enhanced function is now production-ready and provides robust context detection for multi-turn conversations.
